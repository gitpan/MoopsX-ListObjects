DESCRIPTION
    Extends Toby Inkster's Moops sugary class building syntax with
    List::Objects::WithUtils objects.

    Importing MoopsX::ListObjects is the same as importing Moops, but with
    all of the objects available from List::Objects::WithUtils, as well as
    the types and coercions from List::Objects::Types.
